**cem** is a lightweight library for Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), a modern matching method used for causal inference.

Covariate imbalance between treated and control groups can lead to treatment effect estimates that are sensitive to model specification. `cem` aims to reduce this imbalance by temporarily discretising covariates using a multidimensional grid, removing strata that do not contain all levels of the treatment variable, and reweighting the remaining examples.

## Getting started

```bash
pip install cem
```
